    "Both MALLET models highlighted similar topics. We felt that increasing the number of topics to 10 allowed us to get a wider breadth of topics, as there are likely many different genres of artists within our corpus. Although it seems that most of the topic clusters in our first analysis were present in the second analysis (Love, Weather, Gory), the second analysis did a better job illustrating the nuances of many of the major themes in music. For example, I found it interesting that MALLET split topics 6 and 7. Both of these topic clusters seem to be focused around Hip-Hop lyrics, but topic 6 is much more explitive while topic 7 focused on other important themes in Hip-Hop, specifically money, houses, and girls. Overall, the MALLET analysis provides us a good starting point for our similarity analysis, and allows us to more fully understand the major themes of lyrical content within our corpus."

For example, ABBA's song \"Givin' a little bit more\" embodies topic 1 of the first MALLET analysis with a topic 1 score of 0.967, meaning that this song focused on themes such as Love and Life. Comparing the same song to the second MALLET analysis, the song was labeled to have a topic 3 score of 0.509 and a topic 10 score of 0.403, both topics having themes around girls and emotion, similar to topic 1 in the first analysis. It was interesting to compare which topics different songs were attributed to over both analyses."
